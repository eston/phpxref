0.7 - 2/January/2007
    + Parse static and final methods correctly

    + Add support for PHP Interfaces
    
	+ Ignore functions defined in HTML comments (<!-- -->)

    + Compress plain text view of source files if COMPRESS=1 in the cfg file

    + Added new config option LINK_URI - Turning this on links email addresses
      and URLs used in documentation @tags

    + Added new config option EXPLORE_SOURCE - Setting this to 1 makes
      links in the file explorer open the php source, rather than the summary page

    + Added support for changing the content-type used on pages to support other
      character sets - Thanks to uno@venus.dti.np.jp - Configured using the
      CHARSET config parameter

    + Fix javascript bug causing rollover links to function, class and constant
      directions to link to an invalid url

    + Added a project stats page that contains the same information printed at the
      end of a phpxref run (_stats.html) - Linked from the project summary pages


0.6 - 25/October/2004
    + Fixed "file exists" error that occured with Windows ME

    + Added support for some PHP5-isms, including:
      * class Foo implements ...
      * public/private/protected functions
      Note: phpxref doesn't do anything clever with this extra
      information, it just allows the class/method to be detected
      correctly.
      There's no real support for interfaces as yet.

    + Made sure functions/methods beginning/containing underscores
      are indexed

    + Displays class and function names with cOrReCt CaSe in the file
      summary page.

    + Couple more fixes with the Windows builds


0.5 - 16/March/2004
    + Added support for cross referencing constants

    + Added a search/reference history, accessible by clicking the 
      'Search History' link on the search popup that keeps track of 
      functions, variables, constants, classes and tables that have 
      been recently visited.

    + Added a new css class for php function names, along with a 
      new mouseover popup for them

    + A cross reference of files included or required by other files is now
      linked from the file summary page 
      (eg. "Included or required: 14 times" links to a page showing the
      referencing pages)

    + Added variable name highlighting in the source view:  Mouse over a
      variable name and all variables in the file with the same same will be
      highlighted. (note: requires an update to the sample_header.html file)

    + Added a link to the original plain text version of the source file from
      the source view page.

    + Fixed the annoying 'root is not defined' JS error that showed up in IE

    + Fixed parsing of @param style comments so that the DOC_TAG
      configuration option now works.  Turned on reporting of 
      $author, @param, @return and @returns tags by default in 
      the phpxref.cfg file.

    + Added DOC_FILE_TAG option to phpxref.cfg -- Setting this dictates
      which @param tags are used for the actual file description; 
      see the updated phpxref.cfg file for more information.

    + Opening a link that jumps to a specific source line in a new
      browser window/tab now jumps correctly to the right line, even when 
      the framed explorer is turned on.

    + Changed parsing procedure so that reference counts are known by the time 
      the output pass has started; extra information presented on the popups
      as a result
    
    + Entries that appear to be a function or class reference, but for which
      no definition can be found are no longer linked as such.  Dramatically
      cuts down the number of false links

    + Javascript cleanup/reshuffle

    + Fixed end of line comment parsing

    + Fixed bug with function parsing so that function definitions with the
      argument list's opening bracket on the next line are now recognized
      correctly
    
    + Class and function definitions now link to the start of any comment
      block linked to the entry, rather than the entry itself.

    + Updated the PHP function list - This set is a merge of the existing php4
      functionlist with a list extracted from the php 5.0.0b4 source

    + Various fixes to help with Internet Explorer's shortcomings


v0.4.1 - 8/December/2003
    + Classes referenced by sublasses via the 'extends' keyword are
      now cross referenced.

    + Class variables are now cross referenced to some degree
      (the parser has no way to know what class $foo->bar actually
      belongs to)

    + Added 'print' links to the source and summary file views
      and added a print CSS file to improve the formatting of 
      printed files.  Needs a reasonably modern browser to work well.

    + Function definitions with a space between the function name
      and the opening bracket are now indexed.

    + Miscellaneous comment parsing fixes.

    + Added a rollover popup for include and require statements
      so that the user may quickly choose whether to jump to the
      source of the referenced file, or the summary view.


v0.4 - 2/September/2003
    + Fixed a bug that prevented function definitions beginning
      with an ampersand from showing up in the page detail

    + Added a PROJECT variable to the configuration file to hold the short
      name of the project being cross referenced.  Can be inserted into the
      header or footer templates using __PROJECT__ (see updated samples)

    + Added a __TITLE__ variable for use in the header template

    + Added a much more powerful directory-explorer for javascript enabled
      browsers

    + Added COMPRESS option to the configuration file.  When enabled
      output files will be compressed and named with a .gz extension.
      Most browsers will have no problem rendering such files when served
      from a correctly configured web server.
      Requires the IO::Zlib perl module to be installed.

    + Wrap source listings in a pre block instead of using &nbsp;
      for consistent spacing

    + Replaced all the progress dots with percentages

    + Added mouseover popups for functions and classes to the source view
      allowing for quick access to the source definition of each

    + Improved the layout of the file summary pages and directory listing
      pages.  This involved a few changes that affected the css file
      along with the header and footer

    + Framed view is now the default

    + Pushed javascript routines out into a separate file

    + CVS style $Id: lines are now ignored for the purposes of the 
      short description for files

    + Filenames are treated case-insensitively now on operating systems
      using case insensitve filesystems (eg. Windows).
      This affects settings such as BAD_DIRNAMES, etc

    + Various other minor fixes and additions

v0.3.0 - 25/June/2003
    + Added cross referencing of PHP classes

    + Added support for PHPDoc style comments and tags, eg.:
      /**
      * Function description
      * @author Gareth
      */

    + Updated HTML layout to use a stylesheet and improved default layout
      Old configuration options relating to HTML colour are no longer used
      (JS_BG, JS_FG, INFO_BG, FILENAME_BG, COL_COMMENTS, COL_LINENUM)

    + Added basic syntax colouring

    + Improved the handling of require/include references - Constants and 
      variables prepended to require statements are now parsed and can
      be specified in the configuration file
      eg. require(THEME_BASE.'frontpage.php')

    + Added support for cross referencing all references to other files
      ie. not just those referenced in require/include blocks
      (see FULLXREF setting)

    + Improved support for running under Windows (tested with activestate perl
      5.6 and TinyPerl 2.0)

    + Updated documentation

    + Updated the PHP4 functionlist

    + Added some stats to the output summary

    + Filenames ending with a tilde are now always ignored

v0.2.1 - 08/May/2001
	+ Fixed a bug so that the directory crawl now follows symlinks okay

	+ Added a little style to the directory tree frame

	+ Updated the parser so that the '////' start of comments line may
	  have trailing spaces

v0.2 - 30/April/2001
	+ Added include_once and require_once as aliases for include and require

	+ Added the ability to associate author names with php files using
	  a '// filename.php - author: jsmith'
	  syntax - courtesy of Gottfried Szing

	+ Added the looking up of SQL table descriptions referenced in
	  inline comments directly from a MySQL database; added some
	  configuration options to make this work - see the sample.cfg file
	  for details.  Courtesy of Gottfried Szing.

	+ Fixed a bug with BAD_EXT where extensions such as .php~ 
	  (with the trailing tilde) wouldn't be matched

	+ Added support for relative pathnames used with require() or include()
	  so things like:
	  require("../file.php")
	  should now resolve okay if you configure INCLUDEPATH correctly

	+ Fixed a few typos

v0.1.2 - 27/July/2000
	+ Updated the parsing/handling of require and include statements
	to handle more formats.. resolve_require() still needs to
	be improved though (ie. so it handles '../dir/file.php' cases)

	+ Updated the sample.cfg file so that INCLUDEPATH references
	the current directory.


v0.1.1 - 17/July/2000
	+ Initial release
