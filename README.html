    <h2><a name="#synopsis">Synopsis</a></h2>
    <p>
    PHPXref parses a set of PHP files and extracts suitably formatted comments 
    placed in the files to generate a cross-referenced set of HTML documentation 
    that you can view using any web browser, with or without a web server.
    </p>

    <h3>Features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides an easy means of documenting your PHP scripts whilst you code.</li>
        <li>Cross-references classes, functions, variables, constants, include() 
            and require()'d files and SQL table usage.</li>
        <li>Produces a complete class, function, variable, constant and (optionally) 
            a database table list.</li>
        <li>Generates plain HTML output that can be viewed with any web browser and
            downloaded onto the local machine for quick reference.</li>
        <li>Generates a client-side quick-search search box for javascript-enabled
            browsers.</li>
        <li>Pretty-prints PHP pages from your web browser.</li>
        <li>Optionally compresses output files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Requirements:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Perl 5.6 or later.</li>
        <li>A web browser - Having javascript enabled provides a nice search box,
            improves the navigation column and adds tooltip-style popups
            to classes and functions in the source view, but it's optional
            &#151; the system is usable in Lynx, if not quite as feature-rich.</li>
        <li>Some PHP files to cross reference.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    That's it!  No special / non-standard perl modules are required and the script
    is known to work fine under Linux, Windows and OS X and will probably work on other
    platforms as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    You also don't need a web server - You can run the script locally and point
    your browser directly at the index.html file - In fact, this is the recommended
    way to use it as it makes for a very useful and fast programmer's tool.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="quickstart">Quickstart</a></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Extract the PHPXref archive.</li>
        <li>Put a copy of your PHP code to cross reference into the source directory
            or edit phpxref.cfg and edit the SOURCE entry.</li>
        <li>Customize the phpxref.cfg file as you wish.</li>
        <li>Run phpxref.pl (or phpxref.bat or phpxref.exe on Windows)</li>
        <li>Load up the index.html file in the output directory in a browser.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Make sure the INCLUDEPATH setting in the configuration file is correct
    so that scripts that reference other scripts in the source directory find 
    each other.  Additionally, if you have require or include statements
    that use a constant or variable to specify a base directory, specify
    those in the configuration file too.  Eg. if your code specifies:<br>
    <ul>
        <pre>Require(TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY . 'header.php');</pre>
    </ul>
    you may want to set 
    <ul>
        <pre>TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY=templates/</pre>
    </ul>
    in the
    configuration file (be sure not to miss the trailing slash in the above
    example!).
    </p>

    <h2><a name="docs">Documenting your scripts</a></h2>
    <p>
    As of version 0.3, PHPXref supports 
    <a href="http://phpdocu.sourceforge.net/">PHPDocumentor</a> style
    comments for documenting files, classes and functions (support for the old
    documentation format is retained but deprecated).  PHPXref isn't
    intended to be a substitute for projects like phpdoc, but seems to 
    compliment it fairly well.
    </p>
    <p>
    An example function comment might look like..:
    <ul>
        <pre>
/**
* Authenticate a user using a username and password
*
* A longer description of the function might go here
* and can span multiple lines.
* @param string $username
* @param string $password
* @tables users, permissions
* @author Gareth
*/
function authuser($username,$password) {
    // ...
}
        </pre>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cross referencing database table references</h3>
    <p>
    PHPXref can cross reference database table usage in your scripts if you
    provide it with some hints about which tables you're using and where.  This
    is needed as the parser doesn't currently know SQL.  Additionally, if you
    use MySQL, you can have PHPXref go on to fetch the table descriptions
    directly from the database - Instructions for configuring this are in the
    config file.  Note that you must have the Perl DBI modules installed to use
    this feature and the Windows .exe version doesn't include these modules.
    Thus to use this feature under Windows, you must use the .pl script with a 
    full install of Perl.
    </p>
    <p>
    Table hints for PHPXref can be provided either by specifying them as part
    of a file/class/function comment as shown above with the @tables tag.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="windows">Notes for Windows users</a></h2>
    <p>
    Version 0.3 of PHPXref contains some minor updates to help it run under
    Windows, but as I rarely use Windows I'm sure it has some issues remaining.
    If you wish to use PHPXref under Windows then you need to have a working
    installation of Perl.  The easiest way to get this setup is to download
    the ActivePerl installer from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a>
    and allow it to install into C:\Perl.  If you install it into another location
    you'll want to edit the phpxref.bat file before running it.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you really don't want to install Perl, a copy of PHPXref compiled into
    a standalone executable using <a href="http://tinyperl.sourceforge.net/">TinyPerl</a>
    is available on the <a href="http://phpxref.sourceforge.net/">website</a>.
